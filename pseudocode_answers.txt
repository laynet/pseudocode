1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
to communicate to other human programmers looking at the code, or to themselves to help flesh out the logic
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
nothing, it won't run

1. create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater numbers
input number a, number b
if a > b then
print a else
print b

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100
input number
while number <=100 and >0
print number

3. create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook
input an object
call search with string returning answer
return answer
4. using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice
var phoneBook = phonebook object
phoneBook.search("name you're looking for");
