1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
to communicate to other human programmers looking at the code, or to themselves to help flesh out the logic
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
nothing, it won't run

1. create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater numbers
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number
  PRINT the first number
ELSE
  PRINT the second number
END IF

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100

INPUT a number
WHILE the number is greater than 0 and the number is less than or equal to 100 
PRINT number

3. create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook
INPUT an object
FOR all the items in an array
IF the object matches an item in the array THEN
    RETURN the item
ELSE
    RETURN "entry not found"
    
4. using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice
var phonebook = ["Bob Smith", 4696320000, "14 Elm Street", "x"];

function bookSearch(entry) {
  for (var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
    if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
      return entry;
    }
    return "entry not found";
  }
}

console.log(bookSearch("Bob Smith"));
